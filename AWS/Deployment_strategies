 1. Rolling Deployment
📌 Description:
Gradually replaces old instances with new ones in batches.

✅ Pros:
Minimal downtime.

Easy rollback by stopping rollout.

❌ Cons:
Some users may hit old version during transition.

✅ Best Used For:
Non-critical systems or minor updates.
############################################################
Terraform configuration uses a Rolling Deployment Strategy, enabled via the instance_refresh block in the Auto Scaling Group.
instance_refresh {
  strategy = "Rolling"
  preferences {
    min_healthy_percentage = 50
    instance_warmup        = 30
  }
  triggers = ["launch_template"]
}
📌 What this means:
When you update the Launch Template (e.g., new AMI or configuration change), Terraform triggers a rolling replacement of instances.
Only a portion of instances (50% or more) are replaced at a time, ensuring continuous availability.
Each new instance waits 30 seconds (warmup) before being considered healthy.
This prevents downtime or full-scale replacement.

✅ Benefits of This Rolling Strategy:
Zero downtime deployments.
Ensures at least half the instances are always healthy during an update.
Works well for stateless applications like FastAPI behind a load balancer.

2.Blue-Green-Deployment

Run two environments — Blue (current) and Green (new). Switch traffic to Green after validation.
It’s a zero-downtime release technique where:
Blue = currently running, stable version of your application.
Green = new version, deployed in parallel for testing and validation.
Once Green is verified, traffic is switched from Blue → Green (often by updating a load balancer).

Blue-Green Deployment is a technique for releasing applications with zero downtime.

It uses two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (new).

The Blue environment serves current production traffic.

The Green environment hosts the new application version for testing.

Once Green passes validation, traffic is switched from Blue to Green (via load balancer).

If issues occur, traffic can quickly roll back to Blue.

It ensures users never experience downtime or broken features.

This method is ideal for stateless web applications and APIs.

It requires more resources, as both environments run simultaneously.

Blue-Green enhances deployment safety, speed, and rollback capability.

Advantages of Blue-Green Deployment
Advantage	Description
✅ Zero Downtime	You deploy the new version (Green) alongside the current one (Blue). Traffic is only switched once everything is verified, avoiding user impact.
✅ Easy Rollback	If Green has issues, you can switch back to Blue quickly by pointing the load balancer back. No need to redeploy.
✅ Safe Testing in Production	You can test the Green version in a live environment using a subset of traffic or internal endpoints.
✅ Instant Switch-over	Changing the ALB listener to point to Green takes seconds—unlike traditional re-deployments.
✅ Isolated Environments	Green and Blue run in separate EC2 ASGs, avoiding shared-state or config problems.

Disadvantages of Blue-Green Deployment
Disadvantage	Description
❌ Higher Infrastructure Cost	You run two full environments (Blue and Green) at once, doubling compute and resource usage.
❌ Complex Infrastructure Management	You need logic to keep both environments synced in networking, IAM, SGs, monitoring, etc.
❌ Manual Traffic Switching (if not automated)	Without a CI/CD pipeline or automation, the traffic switch can be error-prone or forgotten.
❌ Database Complications	If your app includes a schema change or stateful DB update, you must coordinate carefully (e.g., make DB backward-compatible or use feature flags).

Canary-deployment

Canary Deployment is a progressive rollout strategy used in software deployment where a 
new version of an application is released to a small subset of users first,
while the majority of users continue using the old version.


How it works:
Deploy v1 (stable version) to 100% of users.

Deploy v2 (new version) to a small % of users — e.g., 10–20%.

Monitor v2 for errors, latency, user experience.

If everything is stable:

Increase traffic to v2 gradually (50%, then 100%).

Eventually retire v1.

If issues are detected:

Instantly roll back and stop v2.

Keep users on v1.

provider: Configures the AWS region dynamically using a variable.

aws_vpc (data): Fetches the default VPC in your selected region.

aws_subnets (data): Retrieves all subnets within that default VPC.

aws_ami: Looks up the latest official Ubuntu 20.04 AMI from Canonical.

aws_security_group: Creates a security group allowing HTTP (port 80) from anywhere.

aws_launch_template.v1: Defines how version 1 EC2 instances are launched (AMI, type, user data).

aws_launch_template.v2: Similar to v1 but for version 2, used in canary testing.

aws_lb_target_group.v1: Creates a target group for routing traffic to version 1 instances.

aws_lb_target_group.v2: Another target group, used for version 2 instances.

aws_autoscaling_group.v1: Launches and manages EC2 instances for version 1, linked to tg-v1.

aws_autoscaling_group.v2: Launches version 2 instances with a lower capacity (canary).

aws_lb: Creates a public Application Load Balancer to route HTTP traffic.

aws_lb_listener: Listens on port 80 and forwards traffic to v1 by default.

aws_lb_listener_rule: Overrides the default action to split traffic — 80% to v1, 20% to v2.

Path pattern /: This rule applies to all incoming URLs, enabling global traffic splitting.




✅ Benefits:
Advantage	Description
🧪 Safe Testing	Tests new features on real users without full exposure.
🔁 Easy Rollback	If something goes wrong, traffic is quickly reverted.
📊 Metric-based Control	Decisions can be based on monitoring (CPU, errors, etc).
📈 Supports CI/CD	Enables fast and controlled deployments in pipelines.

❌ Risks / Limitations:
Needs strong monitoring and alerting.

Complex traffic routing setup (ALB, weights).

Data inconsistencies if versions handle DBs differently.

Not ideal for apps that must be deployed uniformly (e.g., real-time multiplayer)

Output the private key to a local file
After terraform apply, run:

terraform output -raw private_key_pem > my-key.pem
chmod 400 my-key.pem
This will:

Create a file my-key.pem in your current directory.

This file is your private SSH key.

✅ Step 2: Set correct permissions (important for SSH)
chmod 400 my-key.pem
✅ Step 3: (Optional) Convert .pem to .ppk for PuTTY
If you're using Windows + PuTTY:
Open PuTTYgen.
Click Load, select my-key.pem.
Click Save private key → Save as my-key.ppk.
