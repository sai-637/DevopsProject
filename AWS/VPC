A VPC, short for Virtual Private Cloud, is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. 
It is a virtual version of a traditional network, logically isolated from other virtual networks in the same AWS account. 
A VPC allows you to launch AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets, in a virtual environment 
that is separate from other AWS accounts or other VPCs. You can configure your VPC's IP address range, subnets, and routing to meet your specific network requirements. 
VPCs are highly secure, scalable, and offer a high degree of customization.

It allows you to define your own networking topology, including your own IP address range, subnets, and routers. 
VPCs can span across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) and regions. You can launch AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases,
and S3 buckets, into a VPC. VPCs provide a secure and isolated environment, helping to meet your networking and security requirements.
You can configure VPC settings, including security groups, network ACLs, and route tables, to manage traffic and access to your resources.






VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is an essential AWS feature that enables customers to establish virtual networks within the cloud. 
VPC protects and isolates EC2 instances, databases and load balancers while protecting from attack by outside forces such as hackers.



once we create vpc, automatically aws creates one route table ,default security group and one network ACL(Access control list).
Then we need to create subnets and Internet gateway .
then attach internet gateway to the vpc
next our subnets are associted with main default route table then go to Route there is only one target local 
when we launch our all instances are used to communicate each other by using local
then we create public route table and private route table,so we can add our public subnets to public route table and
add private subnets to private route table and we should select auto assign public ip to our public subnets.
then enable DNS hostnames to our vpc and create flow in cloudwatch ,cloudwatch is easy to see the logs.
After that we should create IAM policy for permission for flow flow logs role policy.
then create a role ,select EC2 and give permission for policy and create.
then edit trust policy to change ec2 to vpc flow logs.
then go to cloudwatch and creeate one log group then go back to flow logs and edit destination log group here we should give log group name.
then create flow log and then launch one instance in private subnet and launch one instance in public subnet in our vpc.
then connect our instance to server by using RDP in windows or Linux in putty

route table:

A route table is a fundamental component in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps to determine the routing of network traffic within a VPC.
It is a set of rules that define where network traffic destined for a particular destination should be routed. 
Each route table is associated with a specific VPC, and it can be used by multiple subnets within that VPC. 
You can create, modify, and manage route tables in the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.
Route tables can be used to route traffic between subnets, to the Internet, or to directly to another VPC.
###########################################

subnet:

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), a subnet is a range of IP addresses within a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). 
It's a logically isolated section of the VPC's IPv4 or IPv6 address space. 
Subnets can be used to organize and segment resources within a VPC, aiding in network management and security. 
You can create multiple subnets in a VPC, each with its own set of IP addresses and routing configuration. 
Subnets can be associated with Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure high availability and redundancy for your applications.
##########################################

internet gateway:

An Amazon Web Services (AWS) Internet Gateway is a virtual device that provides access to and from the AWS cloud. 
A gateway connects your VPC to another network. For example, use an internet gateway to connect your VPC to the internet.
It serves as a single entry and exit point for internet traffic to and from a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) or a subnet.
The Internet Gateway enables communication between AWS resources and the internet, as well as between AWS resources and other networks.
It acts as a router, filtering and directing traffic based on route tables and network ACLs. 
This ensures secure and controlled access to your AWS resources from the internet.

###################################################

endpoints:
Use a VPC endpoint to connect to AWS services privately, without the use of an internet gateway or NAT device.

####################################################

Peering connections
Use a VPC peering connection to route traffic between the resources in two VPCs.

##################################################

Traffic Mirroring
Copy network traffic from network interfaces and send it to security and monitoring appliances for deep packet inspection.

#################################################

Transit gateways
Use a transit gateway, which acts as a central hub, to route traffic between your VPCs, VPN connections, and AWS Direct Connect connections.

###############################################

VPC Flow Logs
A flow log captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
#################################################

VPN connections
Connect your VPCs to your on-premises networks using AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN).

###############################################
Difference between public subnet and private subnet:

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), public subnets and private subnets are two types of subnets that help organize IP addresses and define the accessibility of resources. 
Public subnets are connected to the internet and allow inbound traffic, whereas private subnets are not directly accessible from the internet and only enable communication within the VPC or VPN.
Public subnets are suitable for hosting public-facing applications, while private subnets are ideal for hosting backend services, databases, and internal applications.
Both public and private subnets can coexist in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create a secure and isolated network architecture.

network access control list in aws

A Network Access Control List (NACL) in AWS is a set of access controls that filters traffic to and from the subnets. 
It provides an additional layer of security by allowing you to define standards and rules for inbound and outbound traffic. 
NACLs are particularly useful for controlling traffic between subnets, servers, and applications in a VPC. 
You can create custom NACLs to permit or deny specific traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. 
AWS provides a default NACL for each subnet, and you can also create custom NACLs to meet specific security requirements.

############################################################

security groups in vpc aws

Security Groups (SGs) are a crucial network security feature in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) AWS. 
An SG acts as a virtual firewall that regulates inbound and outbound traffic to and from instances within a VPC.
You can create security groups to allow or deny specific traffic based on IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. 
SGs are associated with instances and can be used to implement network access control, restrict traffic to and from instances, 
and prevent unauthorized access. This helps maintain the security and integrity of your AWS resources.

##################################################

isolated vpc

An isolated VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a type of VPC that is not directly reachable from the internet and is not peered with other VPCs. 
Isolated VPCs are ideal for sensitive workloads that require maximum security and isolation. They can only be accessed through launch configurations or peered with other VPCs. 
Isolated VPCs are also known as "private" or "invisible" VPCs.
They provide an additional layer of security and segregation for your resources, making them more secure and difficult to access without proper authorization.

########################################################

Elastic IP (EIP) is a static public IP address in Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
It allows you to mask the failure of an instance or instance replacement by providing a fixed public IP address that remains even if the underlying instance changes.
EIPs are useful for DNS associations, load balancers, and applications that rely on static IP addresses. 
You can associate an EIP with any instance in your account, and reassign it to a different instance if the first instance is terminated or interrupted. 
This provides flexibility and reliability for your AWS-based applications.
