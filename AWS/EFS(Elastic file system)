Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easy to set up and manage file systems in the cloud. 
It allows multiple EC2 instances to access a single file system, making it ideal for applications that require shared access to files, 
such as big data analytics, content collaboration, and web servers. 
EFS provides a scalable and highly available NFS file system that can be easily mounted by instances in the same AWS Availability Zone.
It supports both Linux and Windows operating systems
Users can use EFS to manage large files, such as videos and images, and can also use it to store and share sensitive data.

Step-by-Step Guide to Scheduled Scaling
Log in to the AWS Management Console:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Sign in with your AWS credentials.
Navigate to the Auto Scaling Groups:

In the services menu, select EC2.
On the left-hand side, under Auto Scaling, click on Auto Scaling Groups.
Select Your Auto Scaling Group:

Choose the Auto Scaling group you want to set up scheduled scaling for.
Create a Scheduled Action:

With your Auto Scaling group selected, click on the Scheduled Actions tab.
Click Create scheduled action.
Configure the Scheduled Action:

Name: Enter a name for your scheduled action.
Recurrence: Specify the schedule using cron expressions or the frequency (e.g., every day, every week).
Start Time: Set the time when the scaling action should start.
End Time (optional): Set the time when the scaling action should end.
Min Size: Set the minimum number of instances for the Auto Scaling group during the scheduled time.
Max Size: Set the maximum number of instances for the Auto Scaling group during the scheduled time.
Desired Capacity: Set the desired number of instances for the Auto Scaling group during the scheduled time.
Save the Scheduled Action:

Once all fields are configured, click Create to save the scheduled action.
Example: Scaling Up During Business Hours
Let's say you want to scale up your instances during business hours (9 AM to 5 PM) every weekday.

Name: ScaleUpBusinessHours
Recurrence: 0 9 * * 1-5 (Every weekday at 9 AM)
Min Size: 4
Max Size: 10
Desired Capacity: 6
For scaling down outside business hours:

Name: ScaleDownOffHours
Recurrence: 0 17 * * 1-5 (Every weekday at 5 PM)
Min Size: 1
Max Size: 2
Desired Capacity: 1
Verify Scheduled Actions
After creating the scheduled actions, ensure they are listed under the Scheduled Actions tab of your Auto Scaling group.
Check that the settings are correct and reflect your scaling needs.
Using AWS CLI for Scheduled Scaling
You can also create scheduled actions using the AWS CLI. Hereâ€™s an example command to create a scheduled action:

sh
Copy code
aws autoscaling put-scheduled-update-group-action \
    --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
    --scheduled-action-name ScaleUpBusinessHours \
    --recurrence "0 9 * * 1-5" \
    --min-size 4 \
    --max-size 10 \
    --desired-capacity 6
To scale down:

sh
Copy code
aws autoscaling put-scheduled-update-group-action \
    --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
    --scheduled-action-name ScaleDownOffHours \
    --recurrence "0 17 * * 1-5" \
    --min-size 1 \
    --max-size 2 \
    --desired-capacity 1
Additional Tips
Monitoring: Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance of your Auto Scaling group and ensure that your scheduled actions are working as expected.
Adjustments: Review and adjust your scheduled actions periodically based on the actual usage patterns and business needs.
Notifications: Set up notifications to alert you about scaling activities using Amazon SNS.
