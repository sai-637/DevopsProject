Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. 
Upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment—from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto scaling 
to application health monitoring.
Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies the deployment and scaling of applications.

Elastic Beanstalk supports applications developed in Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. 
When you deploy your application, Elastic Beanstalk builds the selected supported platform version and provisions one or more AWS resources, 
such as Amazon EC2 instances, to run your application

To use Elastic Beanstalk, you create an application, upload an application version in the form of an application source bundle (for example, a Java .war file) to Elastic Beanstalk, 
and then provide some information about the application. Elastic Beanstalk automatically launches an environment and creates and configures the AWS resources needed to run your code. 
After your environment is launched, you can then manage your environment and deploy new application versions. 

AWS Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling applications in the cloud. 
By abstracting much of the infrastructure management, it allows developers to focus on writing code and delivering features.
Whether you’re deploying a simple web app or a complex microservices architecture, Elastic Beanstalk provides the flexibility and 
ease of use to get your applications up and running quickly.

1. Create an Application
Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Elastic Beanstalk.
Click on "Create Application".
Provide application details:
Application name: Enter a unique name for your application.
Description: Optionally, provide a description of your application.
2. Configure the Environment
Select the platform:

Choose the platform that matches your application (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java, etc.).
Select the platform branch and version.
Configure more options:

You can either go with the default settings or customize the environment (e.g., instance type, database configuration, VPC settings).
3. Deploy Your Application
Upload the application code:

Click on "Choose file" and upload your application code (ZIP file, WAR file, etc.).
Alternatively, you can connect your application to a GitHub repository for direct deployment.
Review and launch:

Review your configuration settings.
Click on "Create environment" to launch the environment.
4. Monitor and Manage the Application
Dashboard:

The Elastic Beanstalk dashboard provides an overview of your application's health, recent events, and other key metrics.
Logs and Monitoring:

You can view logs and monitor application performance through the CloudWatch metrics integrated into Elastic Beanstalk.
Environment Management:

Manage environment settings, perform rolling updates, and apply configuration changes as needed.
5. Scaling and Load Balancing
Auto-scaling:

Elastic Beanstalk automatically scales your application based on demand.
You can configure auto-scaling rules to adjust the number of instances.
Load Balancing:

Elastic Beanstalk includes an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across instances.
Example: Deploying a Node.js Application
Here’s a step-by-step guide to deploying a Node.js application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

Prepare Your Node.js Application:

Ensure your application is ready for deployment (e.g., package.json is correctly configured).
Zip your application files.
Create an Application and Environment:

Follow the steps above to create a new application.
Choose the Node.js platform.
Deploy the Application:

Upload your zipped application file.
Click "Create environment" and wait for the environment to be set up.
Access Your Application:

Once the environment is ready, Elastic Beanstalk will provide a URL to access your application.
You can now access and test your application.
CLI Deployment with EB CLI
The Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI) allows you to manage Elastic Beanstalk applications from the terminal.

Install the EB CLI:

sh
Copy code
pip install awsebcli
Initialize Your Application:

sh
Copy code
eb init
Create an Environment and Deploy:

sh
Copy code
eb create my-environment
eb deploy
View Environment Status:

sh
Copy code
eb status
