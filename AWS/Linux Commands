-r: Reverse the order of the sort, so that the output is displayed in reverse order.

-h: Human-readable. Prints file sizes in a human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB, GB) instead of bytes.

The chmod command in Linux is used to change the permissions of files and directories. 
Permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.

      chmod 777 file.txt ---> every one can access
      chmod 755 file.txt --->Set read, write, and execute for the owner; read and execute for the group; and read only for others:
      chmod u+x file.txt --->Give the owner execute permission
           Each digit is the sum of the permissions:

7 (4+2+1) = rwx
6 (4+2) = rw-
5 (4+1) = r-x
4 (4) = r--
3 (2+1) = -wx
2 (2) = -w-
1 (1) = --x
0 (0) = ---


he chown command in Linux is used to change the ownership of files and directories. 
This command allows you to modify both the user (owner) and the group associated with a file or directory.

It provides a way to start, stop, restart, and check the status of services. 
The service command is commonly used on older init-based systems like SysVinit, 
but it's also supported on systems using the newer systemd init system for compatibility.

     service serviceName action

On newer systems that use systemd, the service command is often replaced by systemctl.
While service can still be used for compatibility, systemctl is more powerful and provides more detailed control over services.
