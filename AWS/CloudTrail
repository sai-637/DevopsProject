Here's more on cloudtrail in aws

CloudTrail is a logging service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that captures and stores log data from AWS services as events.
These events provide a record of everything that occurs in an AWS account, including user interactions and API calls. 
CloudTrail logs are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or Amazon CloudWatch logs. 
This allows you to track down issues, troubleshoot problems, and ensure compliance with security policies. 
You can also use CloudTrail to monitor and audit the activity of your AWS resources, as well as detect potential security threats.
