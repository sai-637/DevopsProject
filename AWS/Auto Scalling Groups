An auto scaling group (ASG) in AWS is a group of identical EC2 instances that AWS Auto Scaling manages as a single unit. 
You can use ASGs to quickly and reliably respond to changes in application traffic or computer workload. 
ASGs can automatically add or remove EC2 instances based on specified scaling policies, such as "add 2 instances when CPU utilization reaches 50%.
" This helps maintain a consistent application performance and cost efficiency. 
ASGs also support launch configurations, scaling settings, and lifecycle hooks for more granular control over the scaling process.
