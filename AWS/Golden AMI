Golden AMI or Custom AMI(Amazon machine Image):

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), a Custom AMI (also known as a Golden AMI) is an Amazon Machine Image that is custom-built by a user. 
It allows users to create a copy of an existing Amazon AMI and modify it to suit their specific needs, such as installing and configuring specific software or patches. 
Custom AMIs can be used to launch multiple instances with the same configuration, making it easier to manage and maintain a consistent environment across multiple machines. 
This provides more flexibility and control over the instances launched in AWS.



Create Golden AMI:
Create the AMI
Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
Select Instances.
Choose Your Instance.
Create Image:
Actions > Image > Create Image.
Provide a name and description for the image.
Choose whether to include any additional volumes.
Click Create Image.
5. Use the Golden AMI
Launch New Instances:
Navigate to the AMIs section in the EC2 Dashboard.
Select your newly created AMI.
Click Launch to start new instances using this Golden AMI.
Configure the instance as needed (instance type, VPC, subnet, security groups, etc.).
Example Script to Automate AMI Creation (AWS CLI)
You can automate the creation of a Golden AMI using AWS CLI and a script:

sh
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
INSTANCE_ID="i-xxxxxxxx"
IMAGE_NAME="Golden_AMI_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
DESCRIPTION="Golden AMI with standard configuration"

# Stop the instance (optional)
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID
aws ec2 wait instance-stopped --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID

# Create the AMI
IMAGE_ID=$(aws ec2 create-image --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID --name $IMAGE_NAME --description "$DESCRIPTION" --no-reboot --output text)

# Wait for the AMI to be available
aws ec2 wait image-available --image-ids $IMAGE_ID

echo "AMI created with ID: $IMAGE_ID"

# Optionally, restart the instance
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID
Additional Tips
Version Control: Maintain version control for your Golden AMIs by using a naming convention that includes version numbers or dates.
Security: Ensure your AMI adheres to your organizationâ€™s security policies and best practices.
Documentation: Document the process and configurations included in your Golden AMI for future reference and compliance.
