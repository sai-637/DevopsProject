# Access data from the JSON
print(config['key'])

# Write data to a JSON file
data = {'key': 'value', 'list': [1, 2, 3]}
with open('output.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)

Terraform and Python Integration
Terraform is a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Although Terraform itself is not written in Python, you can interact with Terraform through Python scripts using various libraries and techniques.

Python Libraries for Terraform
python-terraform

Purpose: python-terraform is a Python wrapper for Terraform commands. It allows you to programmatically execute Terraform operations such as init, plan, apply, and destroy from within a Python script.

Installation: Install via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install python-terraform
Common Methods:

Terraform.init(): Runs the terraform init command to initialize a Terraform working directory.
Terraform.plan(): Runs terraform plan to create an execution plan.
Terraform.apply(): Runs terraform apply to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.
Terraform.destroy(): Runs terraform destroy to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.
Example:


from python_terraform import Terraform, IsFlagged

# Initialize Terraform
tf = Terraform()
tf.init()

# Create an execution plan
return_code, stdout, stderr = tf.plan()

# Apply the plan
return_code, stdout, stderr = tf.apply(skip_plan=True)

# Destroy the infrastructure
return_code, stdout, stderr = tf.destroy(force=IsFlagged)
Advantages:

Automates the running of Terraform commands within Python scripts.
Allows the integration of Terraform into larger Python automation workflows.
Use Cases:

Automating the deployment of infrastructure from within a CI/CD pipeline.
