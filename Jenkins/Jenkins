When the developer commits the code to the source code repositorythe jenkins server detects the changes that have occured in the source code repository.
Jenkins will detect and pull the changes and will start preparing for a new build.
If build get failed ,developer will communicated about the failure of the build so that they can check the code at their end.
If the build get successfull ,jenkins will deploy the build in test server.
Jenkins will continue to check source code repository for any changes make in source code and keep on repeating the entire process.
