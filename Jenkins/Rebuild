 what is rebuild in jenkins

Rebuild is a feature in Jenkins that allows you to manually trigger a build process for a project.
When you initiate a rebuild, Jenkins will recreate the latest version of the project's artifacts, such as ear, war, or jar files, based on the latest changes in the source code. 
This feature is particularly useful when you need to override previous build results or when you want to ensure that the latest changes are correctly incorporated into the project's artifacts.
To rebuild a project in Jenkins, navigate to the project's configuration page, click the "Rebuild" button, and select the desired build configuration.
Rebuild, using the Rebuilder plugin allows a completed job to be re-executed while allowing you to change the parameters, assuming your job is parameterized
