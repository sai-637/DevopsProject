In DevOps, Nexus plays a crucial role as a repository manager. 
It helps in managing build artifacts and dependencies, making the entire software development lifecycle smoother. 
Nexus is used to store, manage, and distribute artifacts (like JAR, WAR, and ZIP files). 
It acts as a central repository for these components during the software build process.
It supports various repository formats like Maven, npm, NuGet, Docker, and more.

After successful builds, Nexus stores the artifacts (e.g., JAR, WAR files). 
These artifacts can be stored in snapshot or release repositories, depending on the development or production phase.
such as from a snapshot repository (development) to a release repository (production).

Nexus integrates seamlessly with CI/CD tools like Jenkins to automatically upload build artifacts after a successful build.
This ensures that the latest builds are readily available for deployment.
Pipelines can be designed to fetch dependencies from Nexus during the build and push build outputs (artifacts) back to Nexus for further deployment or testing.

Nexus provides role-based access control (RBAC), allowing organizations to control who has access to various repositories. 
This ensures security and governance over critical software artifacts.
It also supports artifact scanning to ensure that artifacts stored or used in the build process are free of vulnerabilities, 
contributing to a more secure DevOps pipeline.
