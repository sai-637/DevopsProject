The Kube Controller Manager is a critical component of the Kubernetes control plane. 
Its primary responsibility is to run and manage controllers, which are responsible for enforcing the desired state of the cluster. 
These controllers manage various aspects of the cluster, such as node health, pod scheduling, and persistent storage. 
The Controller Manager is responsible for creating and managing these controllers, ensuring they are running and functioning correctly.
It also handles communication between controllers and other components, like the API Server, to ensure the cluster remains in a stable and secure state.

In kubernetes terms, a controller is a process that continuously monitors the state of the components within the 
system and works towards bringing the whole system to the desired functioning state.

Node Controller
Responsible for monitoring the state of the Nodes and taking necessary actions to keep the application running.

Replication Controller
It is responsible for monitoring the status of replicasets and ensuring that the desired number of pods are available at all time within the set.
