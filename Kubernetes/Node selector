Node selector:

A node selector in Kubernetes is a key-value pair that is used to schedule pods on specific nodes in a cluster. 
It allows you to label nodes with specific attributes and then use those labels to select which nodes a pod should run on.
This is useful for a variety of use cases, such as scheduling a pod on a node with a specific amount of memory or CPU, or 
scheduling a pod on a node with a specific operating system. Node selectors are defined as part of a pod's configuration and 
can be used in combination with other scheduling options to ensure that your pods are deployed to the right nodes.

Node selectors in Kubernetes allow you to control which nodes your pods are scheduled on by defining specific label-based constraints. 
By using node selectors, you can tell Kubernetes to run a pod only on nodes that match certain labels.

kubectl label nodes node1 size=Large


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: frontend
    image: frontend-image
  nodeSelector:
    size: Large

The nodeSelector field specifies key-value pairs (e.g., size=Large).
Kubernetes will only schedule the pod on nodes with both labels.
