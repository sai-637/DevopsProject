Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment, management, and configuration of Kubernetes applications. 
It allows developers and operators to bundle Kubernetes manifests (e.g., Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps) into reusable and shareable packages called charts.
With Helm, users can create and share reusable templates for deploying applications, and manage dependencies and configurations in a centralized manner. 
This makes it a popular tool among Kubernetes developers and administrators.

Key Features of Helm
1.Application Packaging (Charts):
Helm bundles all Kubernetes resources required for an application into a chart, enabling easy sharing and deployment.

2.Declarative Management:
Helm simplifies managing applications as code, promoting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.

3.Customization with Values:
Helm charts come with default configuration values (values.yaml), which can be overridden for customization.

4.Release Management:
Helm tracks application deployments (referred to as releases) and manages their lifecycle, including upgrades, rollbacks, and deletions.

5.Dependency Management:
Helm charts can include dependencies on other charts, making it easier to deploy complex applications.

How Helm Works
1.Helm Chart:
A Helm chart is a collection of YAML templates that define Kubernetes resources and configuration files.

2.Helm Release:
When you deploy a Helm chart to your Kubernetes cluster, it becomes a release. Each release is an instance of the chart, 
allowing multiple deployments of the same application with different configurations.

3.Helm Repository:
Charts are stored in repositories (like Docker images in a container registry). Public repositories include ArtifactHub and Bitnami.

Basic Helm Commands
1.Install a Chart: Deploy an application using a Helm chart:
helm install my-release my-chart

2.List Releases: View all active releases:
helm list

3.Upgrade a Release: Update an application with new configurations or a newer version of the chart:
helm upgrade my-release my-chart

4.Rollback a Release: Revert to a previous version if something goes wrong:
helm rollback my-release

5.Uninstall a Release: Remove an application and its Kubernetes resources:
helm uninstall my-release
